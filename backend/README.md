# Server and DB for Plant Nursery

## Prerequisites

Install poetry on your machine.

Run `poetry init` in the 'backend' directory (this contains pyproject.toml)

## Execution

Run `poetry shell` to create a virtual environment and `poetry install` to install all required dependencies in that venv.

Start the server by running `poetry run start-server`. This must be executed from the 'backend' directory. Now the server is up and running in dev mode!
